The Mythic Scale of Steinbeck’s Environmental Fiction | An Earth Systems Capstone | Erin Pang |<br><br>

Abstract<br><br>

<p><i>Steinbeck’s novels are often noted for depicting the relationships between people and their
environments and the ways in which human and environmental systems are interconnected.
When environmental crises occur in his stories, they arise because humans have lost this sense of
scale and have ceased to understand themselves as part of an interconnected system. But
dealing with an issue of such vast scale poses challenges. How does one show that the invisibly
small (from the nutrients in soil to phytoplankton in the ocean) is connected to the
incomprehensibly large (from the ocean tides to the Earth itself)? Steinbeck’s solution is to use
mythic elements to appeal to our primitive relationship with the natural world, evoking an
intuitive understanding of the complexity of global systems. Faced with today’s environmental
crisis, it is worthwhile to revisit Steinbeck’s works as environmental literature that can teach us
how to communicate the importance of living in accordance with the environmental systems
that sustain us.</i></p>


At the time that Steinbeck was writing, environmental degradation, at least in the modern
context of climate change, had not yet been identified as a foremost challenge facing humanity,
and thus Steinbeck’s works were not originally read as environmental literature. However, their
recognition of humans’ impact on the environment were advanced for their time, and if
literature is meant to interact dynamically with readers and their circumstances, then now may
be the appropriate time to ask what Steinbeck’s striking vision of humans and the environment
can tell us about our current environmental challenges . . .

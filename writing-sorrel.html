<font size="+5">T</font>he cat wouldn’t stop following her around the graveyard. It was a white and orange cat, a
little scruffy. She had slipped out from behind a gravestone as Sorrel was trying to make out the
name and date on the inscription. It sprang up onto the low faded white fence surrounding the
gravestone and sat there looking at her. Its eyes were a warm amber that were pretty and
rather unsettling. <br><br>
Sorrel watched it. The cat leapt off the fence and rustled the leaves as it went to sit beside
the gravestone Sorrel was studying. It watched her again. She watched it, then moved on to the
next gravestone. It slunk after her. They repeated this ritual for a few minutes. The cat sat and
watched her with its tail slowly sweeping back and forth, making the dry leaves go swish … swish
… swish. Sorrel felt unsettled, a strange tingle behind her eyes. <br><br>
Up until the cat began following her, the graveyard had seemed a very peaceful, pretty
place, with the cool fresh autumn air smelling of earth, and the sunlight filtering through the
thick cover of trees. It was covered in a thick carpet of leaves, and the fences around the
gravestones were in poor shape, all this giving Sorrel the sense that the graveyard belonged
here and had sprung up as naturally as the bay laurel and maples had more than a century ago.
Yet there were little signs that it wasn’t a completely neglected cemetery. A couple of the graves
had bouquets of wildflowers lying before them, wilted but not yet decomposed. Sorrel
wondered who it was that still left flowers. Did these people buried in the 1800s still have family
here who knew of them? <br><br>
One bouquet of once-yellow daisies lay before the grave of a Jenny Danielson, passed away
in 1888 at two years old. It seemed eerie somehow, that a child who died more than a century
ago inexplicably had flowers by her grave. It almost was easier to believe that a specter silently
left those flowers there in the dead of the night than to believe that there were family members
around here who still cared to tend the grave of their great-great-great aunt.
The cat was still watching her, but it kept its distance. It stood with its tail twitching warily
and its head tilted to one side. Her imagination began to entertain little stories about the cat.
Perhaps it communed with the spirits of the dead at night. Perhaps it was one of the dead
spirits. Perhaps it was trying to tell her, Sorrel, a message. <br><br>
Sorrel turned and decided to go about her business and put the cat out of her mind. She
wandered by the other gravestones. Many of them had names too faded and worn to make out,
but some of them were still readable. <br><br>
Ellen Keenan had died in 1886. Daniel Acheves died in 1898. Roberto Berryessa died in 1895.
And then there was the grave of the arm of Richard Bertram (Bert) Barrett. Sorrel had
learned the story of Bertram Barrett during an elementary school fieldtrip. Bert was sixteen
when he lost his arm to a shotgun in a hunting accident. According to the law of the time, the
arm was to be buried in a grave. Bert himself lived another 61 successful years before he passed
away and was buried eleven miles away from his arm in Oak Hills Memorial Park. Legend has it,
that on some nights, the arm claws itself from its grave and goes in search of its body. In
retrospect, it was quite a garish tale to tell to little fourth graders. <br><br>
The afternoon had grown chilly as clouds had advanced from over the hills. Their movement
created shifting patterns of light and shadow over the little graveyard, and the breeze lifted a
little, pulling leaves from their branches and swirling them among the graves. The cat had leapt
onto one of the gravestones and now stood balancing there, flicking its tail as it watched her.
Not creepy at all. Sorrel shivered and zipped her jacket up. It was time to go back; she’d been
here more than an hour already. Sorrel turned around and bid farewell to her companion at the
gate. The cat leaped onto the gate but didn’t follow any further. It sat there and watched as

Sorrel got into her car and drove away. With a last glance in her rearview mirror, Sorrel saw it
fixed there on the fence. Strange. Maybe the cat was a spirit after all, cursed never to leave the
confines of the cemetery.

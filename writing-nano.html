<font size="+5">S</font>yra wandered the late summer hills at dusk. The fluff of the Corinda plant floated through the air and stuck in her hair and even her eyelashes. This was one of the most beautiful places she’d ever seen, and she’d been here so many times without tiring of it. The grass on the hills were a ripe gold and rustled in the soft breeze. The hills rolled on up until they met the Galidan Mountains in the near distance, great grey giants that touched the clouds. Up at the crest of the hill, the woods began and seeped down into the gullies between hills. <br><br>
Syra made her way towards one of these hill folds where she sensed the soft smell of running water. It stirred something in her, an eagerness to be on her way somewhere but at the same time the desire to be still and meditative and do nothing but breath in sweet air. The trees in the gully were great gnarled oaks and the delicate, fragrant bay laurels. Sure enough, she heard the running of a stream, which she found to be little more than a trickle between rocks. It ran merrily on its way down towards the base of the hills, in the direction of Dornilhul. From here, the school was obscured by trees, but Syra knew it was there, with its great spires and stone walls. <br><br>
Here under the cover of trees, evening had fallen more quickly, and she decided regretfully that it was time to go back. She emerged from the woods and found the trail again, the one that she walked so often, leading up to the crest of the hill and then back down to the main road that led to Dornilhul. Torches began to flicker on in the tower windows and along the rampart walls, but with the darkness obscuring all else, Syra could easily pretend that the school and the town beyond it were not there. No, those lights were the lights of spirits, the Fialhor of legend, that lit their fires in their nightly games. Some were meant to lead travellers astray while some were meant to guide them safely to their destinations. The trick was to discern which lights were which. <br><br>
The Fialhor had not been heard of on this land for many ages, Syra mused. So she must be walking in a world where Dornilhul and the city of Rolnialla would not exist for many thousands of years. And she would be the only human of her kind in the land, alone in a land of ephemeral spirits. This was a strangely comforting thought. How kind the world seemed with no obligations to her Masters or classmates. Her mother would not expect her home for dinner at the most inconvenient times. No sandy-haired boy to pine over. <br><br>
She came into sight of the road and shook herself out of her reverie. She gave a little laugh and banished her ungrateful thoughts. All these things that she walked the hills to escape, she was truly grateful for. She turned and looked back at the hills and the woods and the mountains, now almost indiscernible in the dark. The black mass of mountains loomed and dominated the landscape in a way that they could not in the daytime. She breathed in deeply one more time. She breathed in the remaining heat of the day, seeping out from the ground with the gentle scent of dirt and summer grass. Then she turned back towards the school and walked on. <br><br>

Back at Dornilhul, she made it to the great hall just before they stopped serving dinner. She edged onto the end of one of the near-empty long benches and ate her rice and stew alone. Outside the tall windows that reached from floor to ceiling, the sky was pitch black now, no moon in sight. The darkness seemed to seem in a bit, despite all the torches and weir lights set along the grey stone walls. <br><br>
“Syra!” said a cheerful voice behind her. She turned and saw Liohnen standing behind her with a stack of books in her arms. “Where have you been?” <br><br>
“Taking a walk,” said Syra with a small shrug. She smiled and motioned for Liohnen to sit beside her. The stack of books featured a list of obscure titles that Syra had never heard of, but then Liohnen had long since ventured into the esoteric study of the magical power of words. It had been a long time since spoken language was commonly used to cast magic. <br><br>
“You and your walks,” Liohnen sighed. “You sure you’re feeling okay?” <br><br>
Syra laughed. “Of course. I just like walks.” <br><br>
Liohnen shrugged. “Want to go to the Weriestan stacks with me?” <br><br>
“Sure.” Syra shoveled the last of her stew-soaked rice into her mouth and stood to go. <br><br>
The Weriestan stacks were in the west wing of the school’s main library. They contained most of the school’s books on magical lore and history. Syra and Liohnen specialized very different magical studies, but they both required looking into the histories written by long-dead scholars about the knowledge and use of magic in the past. So it was a custom of theirs to spend long nights sharing a reading nook poring over their musty volumes, sometimes feeding off each others concentration and more often distracting each other with amusing details they each found in their tomes. <br><br>
Tonight, Syra wasn’t working her way through a stack of scholarly histories, however. For the past months, she’d been investigating books of old myths and legends and even children’s stories. Even more that the history books that she loved so much, despite resenting their dense, dull passages half the time, these mythic stories made her eyes light up and her heart race. She kicked off her slippers and pulled her feet up onto the chair and hunched over her book. <br><br>
This particular legend was one that had been told for many centuries before it was written down by scribes, so this version of it was likely just one of many hundreds that had been told before. The three books Syra had stacked beside her contained other variations of the same story. <br><br>
It was a story about an elfling girl long ago who was born from the shape of moonlight reflecting off a stream. In this version, it was the moon herself who shaped her light to give birth to the elfling. In another version, it was the river that shaped its waters to create the girl. This elfling girl, with no earthly parents, wandered her way through the woods and spent her days peering at the patterns that light made – she watched the way the sun dappled the grass through the tree canopy, she pondered the shapes that the weir lights made in the nighttime marshes, she looked at the constellations traced out in starlight. But she always felt the keenest kinship with moonlight on water. And as she grew older, she felt more and more that she could speak the language of the light. She would watch the way the moon reflected on a pond or creek or river and whisper to it in her mind. And it seemed that the water or the light, she could not tell which, would respond to her whispers. It would dance to her will. <br><br> One night, while whispering her secrets to a moonlit stream, she thought she saw it take the shape of a beckoning hand that gestured for her to follow a small creek tributary. Taking a leap across the shining rocks of the stream, she ducked into the underbrush and followed the beckoning light down the path of the creek. She came at last to a large mossy rock, and from a little hollow in the rock, which she could scarcely fit her head into, came the trickle of a spring. It was this spring that fed the creek which ran into the stream from which the elfling girl had been born. The girl put her fingers curiously into the spring's bubble, and suddenly, the language of the water and the light became clear to her. Her whispers were not only idle suggestions but became absolute truth. As she sang, the water danced in perfect rhythm. When she commanded the water to freeze, it froze. When she told it to surge up in a wave, it did so. <br><br>
And this was where the stories diverged most. In some versions, the elfling girl remained a girl forever and spent the rest of her days teaching the water to dance and run through the forest and to bring water to new lands. She brought water into the great deserts of old, which then also became woods. And to this day, some stories said, the spirit of the elfling girl lives in all the woodland rivers and streams. In another version of the story, she grew up and was a stooped woman many centuries old when the age of humans finally came. By then, the elfling had perfected her language of water such that she could teach it to humans. Soon after, when some humans were able to learn the language of water, she returned to the mossy rock where she had first discovered her powers and fell peacefully asleep and dissolved into the mossy ground, forever fed by the water of her spring. <br><br>
“I’m hungry,” said Liohnen, jolting Syra out of her fairy stories. Syra now had one book opened on the table and another propped open in her lap, cross-referencing two versions of the elfling girl story. Many historians at Dornilhul found it silly to use myths and fairytales in serious research, but Syra felt that these stories were tugging her closer and closer to some revelation that was just out of grasp. They all held hints and traces of the beginning of magic. They were disguised in wildly fantastical premises, but they must have grown out of some measure of truth. <br><br>
“Want to get something to eat?” Liohnen prompted. “The worst thing about this library is they don’t let us bring food.”<br><br>
“We just had dinner.” <br><br>
“You just had dinner,” said Liohnen. “Besides, that was almost three hours ago. Long since time for a snack.”
Syra hadn’t realized they’d passed three hours in the library already. It felt like less than one hour had passed, she’d been so absorbed in her books. She flipped through her notebook and found she’d filled five pages with notes. <br><br>
“Alright, lets get food.”<br><br>
They left their books in the shelf of reserved books and sought out the . . . <br>
